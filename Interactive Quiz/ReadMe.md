## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, all you need is a modern web browser.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd quiz-app
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to launch the quiz app:
   - You can simply double-click on the `index.html` file or open it in a browser.

## Usage

1. **Start the Quiz**: 
   - Click the "Start Quiz" button to begin the quiz.
   - Questions will be displayed one at a time.

2. **Answering Questions**: 
   - Select one of the four answer choices. The app will automatically mark your answer as correct or incorrect.
   - Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through questions.

3. **Hints**: 
   - Use the "Show Hint" button if you need help with the current question.

4. **Timer**: 
   - Each question has a timer (default is 30 seconds). If time runs out, the quiz will automatically move to the next question.

5. **Submit Quiz**: 
   - After answering all questions, click the "Submit Quiz" button to see your final score.

6. **Restart or Exit**: 
   - You can choose to restart the quiz or exit once the quiz is complete.

## Customization

1. **Adding/Editing Questions**: 
   - To add or modify the quiz questions, open `scripts.js` and modify the `questions` array. Each question consists of a `question` string, an `answers` array (with `text` and `correct` fields), and an optional `hint` string.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const questions = [
       {
           question: "What is the capital of France?",
           answers: [
               { text: "Berlin", correct: false },
               { text: "Paris", correct: true },
               { text: "Madrid", correct: false },
               { text: "Rome", correct: false }
           ],
           hint: "It's also known as the 'City of Lights'."
       },
       // Add more questions here
   ];
   ```

2. **Changing Timer Duration**:
   - The timer is set to 30 seconds by default. You can modify the `timeLeft` variable in the `scripts.js` file to change the duration.

   ```javascript
   let timeLeft = 30; // Change 30 to any desired number of seconds
   ```
